## Project Overview<a name = "overview"></a>   
Project Instructions:
>Well-designed UI that is fit for purpose and provides a good user experience
>Uses some form of data storage. Using settings is not enough, this must be either file
storage using a JSON format or a database system (local) to manage the data for the
application. The data that is managed can include settings that you read at start up and
maintain based on the user preferences.
>Demonstrates appropriate use of the sensors/hardware available on UWP capable devices
>The app must be more than a simple information app
>You need to create a test plan as part of the submission to show how you have tested the
application and tracked any issues that have arisen from this testing process



For this project I decided to make an application which lets the user add a number of recips to a database. As well as the user being able to add, edit and delete ingredients 
the user is able to add an image from either the phones gallery or take a picture using the phones camera.
